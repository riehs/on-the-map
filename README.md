# On the Map

This project was created by Daniel Riehs as part of Udacity.com's ios Developer Nanodegree program.

After authenticating with Udacity, the user is shown a map containing information posted by other students in the program. The user can add his or her own pin by posting a string that is reverse geocoded to a location.
